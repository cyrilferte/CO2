Contenue.create!(title: "Carbon Dioxide Capture by Chemical Absorption: A Solvent Comparison Study ", abstract: "In the light of increasing fears about climate change, greenhouse gas mitigation
technologies have assumed growing importance. In the United States, energy related CO2
emissions accounted for 98% of the total emissions in 2007 with electricity generation
accounting for 40% of the total1
. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the
options that can enable the utilization of fossil fuels with lower CO2 emissions. Of the
different technologies for CO2 capture, capture of CO2 by chemical absorption is the
technology that is closest to commercialization. While a number of different solvents for
use in chemical absorption of CO2 have been proposed, a systematic comparison of
performance of different solvents has not been performed and claims on the performance
of different solvents vary widely. This thesis focuses on developing a consistent
framework for an objective comparison of the performance of different solvents. This
framework has been applied to evaluate the performance of three different solvents –
monoethanolamine, potassium carbonate and chilled ammonia. ", url: "https://sequestration.mit.edu/pdf/Anusha_Kothandaraman_thesis_June2010.pdf")

Contenue.create!(title: "BOOK: CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE", abstract: "What is CO2 capture and storage and how could it
contribute to mitigating climate change?
Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a
process consisting of the separation of CO2 from industrial
and energy-related sources, transport to a storage location
and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. This report
considers CCS as an option in the portfolio of mitigation
actions for stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations.
Other mitigation options include energy efficiency
improvements, the switch to less carbon-intensive fuels,
nuclear power, renewable energy sources, enhancement of
biological sinks, and reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gas
emissions. CCS has the potential to reduce overall mitigation
costs and increase flexibility in achieving greenhouse gas
emission reductions. The widespread application of CCS
would depend on technical maturity, costs, overall potential,
diffusion and transfer of the technology to developing
countries and their capacity to apply the technology, regulatory
aspects, environmental issues and public perception", url: "https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_wholereport.pdf")

Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), is published under the title Climate Change 2014. This
report distils, synthesizes and integrates the key findings of the three
Working Group contributions – The Physical Science Basis, Impacts,
Adaptation, and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change – to
the AR5 in a concise document for the benefit of decision makers in
the government, the private sector as well as the public at large. The
SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out
in 2011 dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change
Mitigation, and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to
Advance Climate Change Adaptation. The SYR, therefore, is a comprehensive
up-to-date compilation of assessments dealing with climate
change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic
literature in the field.", url: "https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf")
